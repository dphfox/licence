# License information

My open-source projects are licensed under BSD 3-Clause License + Security Disclaimer.

## Summary

This is not a replacement for the legal text:

- You can use, modify, and share this software, but keep my copyright notice and disclaimer.
- Don’t use my name or contributors' names to promote your version without permission.
- This software is provided "as is" with no guarantees — I’m not liable for any issues or damages.

## Notes on maintenance

I share my projects because I personally wanted them to exist in the world. I might maintain them. I might not.
Contributions are welcome, but I do not make guarantees about those either.

Feel free to use my projects, but if you're about to depend on it big time, the security audit's on you. If, for whatever reason, you end up in a spot of bother, you should probably not have used a random project from someone's GitHub without inspecting what it does properly. I take no responsibility for that.
